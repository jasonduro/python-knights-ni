Pre-Work: Before You Start the Course
 
Reflection questions (to complete before your first mentor call)
 
What experiences have you had with coding and/or programming so far? What other experiences (programming-related or not) have you had that may help you as you progress through this course?
I’ve completed the Full Stack Development portion of the Career Foundry course so far. I’ve also worked as a Product Manager for 3 years, working with developers and designers on SaaS-related projects. 
What do you know about Python already? What do you want to know?
I know that it is a powerful scripting language. I’ve heard of people creating scripts with python to automate tasks. I’d like to know how I can use python to write scripts and automate tasks. 
What challenges do you think may come up while you take this course? What will help you face them? Think of specific spaces, people, and times of day of week that might be favorable to your facing challenges and growing. Plan for how to solve challenges that arise.
I think the challenges I face will be with understanding the curriculum as written by Career Foundry. I’ve had difficulty before, especially when it comes to information that is out of date. Then, I would have to either use the version that was provided or figure out on my own how to use the updated version but still manage to complete the task from CF. In all honesty, ChatGPT has helped me tremendously to understand the course content better, to help understand what is happening with my code, and to better troubleshoot issues when I need it. 

Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python
Learning Goals
 
●  	Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
●  	Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python
 
Reflection Questions
 
In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
Frontend is how people interact with software. It is the device and/or interface that is used to accomplish whichever task the user is trying to accomplish. Backend is the underlying computation that is happening that connects with the frontend. A server that hosts a database is considered the backend. That database contains useful information that the frontend needs in order to interact with and accomplish user goals. 
 
Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option?
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)
There are a lot of similarities between Javascript and Python. They are both scripting languages, they both use easily understandable keywords to make commands and perform tasks, and both use dynamic typing. Depending on the project - especially if the goal of the project is to develop a prototype - then using Python might be the easier choice because of the simple built-in package management, python frameworks with pre-installed web operations, easier debugging, and the strong community support. 


 
Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
I’d like to learn more about the power of Python and it’s capabilities. I think, through this achievement, I will be able to understand some of python’s main features. I see myself working on ways to connect some hardware devices, like bluetooth, through python scripts running that would enable features to be accessed from a mobile device. I know bluetooth technology isn’t directly related to python programming but I believe that I can create a script via python that can connect to some aspects of bluetooth LE audio.
