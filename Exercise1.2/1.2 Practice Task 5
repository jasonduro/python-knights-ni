### PRACTICE Exercise 5: DICTIONARIES
Time for your last practice task of the Exercise! To practice what youâ€™ve learned, complete the following steps and take screenshots after each step:

1. Make a list of the months in a year, and store it as `months_named`.
2. Next, make another list of numbers ranging from 1 to 12 as `months_numbered`.
3. Use the `zip()` function to merge the two lists together into a dictionary called `months_dict` such that the values in `months_named` act as the keys for the dictionary. An example of a key-value pair in this dictionary would be `October: 10`.
4. Clear both initial lists (`months_named` and `months_numbered`) with the `clear()` method available to them.
5. Print the entire dictionary onto your screen.
6. Finally, convert the keys of this dictionary back into another list, `months_extracted`, and then list them in alphabetical order.
