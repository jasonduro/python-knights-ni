CODE PRACTICE 4: STRINGS

Assume that you’ve run the following statements:

>>> str1 = 'hello, '
>>> str2 = 'how are you?'
>>> str3 = str1 + str2
>>> print(str3)
>>> 'hello, how are you?'

0, -18 = h
1, -17 = e
2, -16 = l
3, -15 = l 
4, -14 = 0
5, -13 = ,
6, -12 = ' '
7, -11 = h
8, -10 = o
9, -9 = w
10, -8 = ' ' 
11, -7 = a
12, -6 = r
13, -5 = e 
14, -4 = ' '
15, -3 = y
16, -2 = o
17, -1 = u
18, 0 = '?'


To practice what you’ve learned, without using Python’s shell, work out on your own what the following statements would return:

str3[3:]
returns: lo, how are you?

str3[-3:]
returns: you?

str3[2:9:3]
returns: l,o

str3[::-2]
returns: o, y, e, a, w, h, ',', l, e 
^ incorrect - correct answer is: '?o r o olh'
	the starting position is still '?', then you move every -2 	positions. 

str3[2:8]
returns: llo, h
