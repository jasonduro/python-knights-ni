### Practice Exercise

To begin, copy the following lines of text into a text file, and then save it as “codepractice1.txt”:
`1000
0.145
3`

Now navigate to the directory where this text file is stored, open an IPython shell, and copy each of the following lines into your shell to store these values as their respective variables:

    f = open('codepractice1.txt', 'r')
    lines = f.readlines()
    [principal, rate, time_period] = [x.strip('\n') for x in lines]
    f.close()

This command 1) reads your saved text file, 2) turns the lines into values, and then 3) assigns them to the variables `principal`, `rate`, and `time_period`.
You now have three variables:
1. `principal` = 1000
2. `rate` = 0.145
3. `time_period` = 3

Convert each of the variables—`principal`, `rate` and `time_period`—into the `float` data type through explicit type conversion, and reassign these values to their own respective variables (e.g., `principal = float(principal)`).
    1. f_principal = float(principal)
    2. f_rate = float(rate)
    3. f_time_period = float(time_period)

Now calculate the new compounded principal from the formula below, using the mathematical operations from earlier (remember that time_period will use exponation operators //). Assign the result to the variable name compounded_principal (Compounded Principal = Principal * (1+Rate) {Time_Period} ).
